# So Laki

this is a small project aimed at the battle ground community of hearthstone.

the idea is to see a couple of things (as of now)
1. Where you rank in terms of the following
- how often you lose 50/50 battles (though this is tricky and requires some refinment)
- percentage of units received below your tier


this aggregate adjusts your configuration. As the project grows accuracy will increase as well, as this in the initial phase of the extension and there is still a lot to be learned.

Once launched there will be a contrubution guide and a a donation section as servers are expensive. 

If there is no Contribution section then it means that it is still in building fase and if you want to reach out and help and collaborate then send me an email ctfrancia@gmail.com


thanks!
